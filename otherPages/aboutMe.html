              <p class="justified-text"> This photo was taken during a performance of my own arrangement of a bachata song. 
                    While I don’t have many big stage experiences, I primarily play for my own enjoyment and derive a lot of joy from it.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I taught myself how to play the guitar and never had a formal teacher, 
                    relying instead on online courses and resources available on the internet.  
                    For a time, I played in a band, but due to circumstances beyond my control, the project didn’t succeed.<br/>
                    <br/> 
                    Nowadays, I occasionally collaborate on small creative projects with like-minded individuals who share 
                    a sense of creativity and vision. Additionally, I express myself artistically by sharing reels of my music on Instagram.

              <h4>Youth Musical Theatre</h4>
              <p class="justified-text">This photo captures a moment from my first major stage performance with a youth musical theatre group. 
                As part of the production, I portrayed a vampire, 
                combining singing, dancing, acting, and even playing the guitar to bring the character to life.<br/>
                <br/> 
                During my time with the theatre, I had the opportunity to learn various dance styles and hone my singing skills, 
                making this experience both challenging and exhilarating.<br/><br/> Unfortunately, 
                due to increasing responsibilities related to my studies and professional life, 
                I had to step away from the group. Nonetheless, 
                it was an unforgettable journey that helped me grow as a performer 
                and allowed me to meet incredible people along the way.

              <h4>Home made gym</h4>
              <p class="justified-text">I started my strength training journey as a teenager at the age of 13, 
                    beginning with calisthenics exercises like push-ups and pull-ups.<br/>
                    <br/> 
                    My first experience with a gym came when I was 17, during high school, 
                    where we had access to a weight room once a week. Later, 
                    I got a membership at a local commercial gym and trained regularly until I had to stop at 21 due to my first injury. 
                    After nearly three years of recovery, I returned to training.
                    While working abroad in a small town with no gym access, I built my own outdoor gym, 
                    where I trained even during the winter months. <br/><br/>Now that I live in a larger city, 
                    I no longer face such challenges and enjoy the convenience of modern gyms. 
                    This journey has taught me resilience and the value of adapting to circumstances to pursue my passion for fitness.

              <p class="justified-text">After suffering another injury, this time to my back, I’ll need to pause weightlifting for a while.<br/><br/> However, 
                I’m determined not to give up so easily. 
                I plan to focus on calisthenics, using this time to develop my skills and strengthen my body in new ways. 
                Additionally, I’ll need to dedicate more time to stretching, as I’ve neglected this aspect of training, which partially contributed to my injury. 
                I really don’t enjoy stretching—it’s my nemesis—but it’s something I have to do. <br/><br/>When the time is right, 
                I’ll return to lifting weights, stronger than ever. 
                This journey is a reminder that progress doesn’t stop with setbacks—it evolves.

              <p class="justified-text">Over two years ago, I began learning social dances, primarily focusing on bachata, 
                and I quickly fell in love with it.<br/><br/> Mastering a new skill like partner dancing, where communication happens without words, 
                is incredibly stimulating and exciting. It allows you to truly let loose on the dance floor, 
                and the time spent there flows smoothly and enjoyably. <br/><br/>However, 
                dancing is not just about entertainment—it’s also a fantastic way to build connections and meet many interesting people. 
                Through this journey, I’ve had the chance to encounter a wide variety of fascinating individuals, including, as it turns out, 
                a programming mentor. This unique combination of joy, growth, and unexpected opportunities makes dancing an essential 
                and enriching part of my life.

              <h4>Hiking</h4>
              <p class="justified-text">Hiking has been a passion of mine since I was a child. 
                My father often took me and my siblings on mountain adventures, 
                and growing up in a town surrounded by mountains meant there were always trails to explore. <br/><br/>
                Nowadays, due to limited time, I can’t hike as frequently as I used to, but whenever I get a moment, 
                I seize the opportunity to reconnect with nature. 
                Being out in the mountains allows me to clear my mind and find peace amidst the beauty of the natural world.

            <h4>Books</h4>
            <p class="justified-text">Books have become a significant part of my life, although I didn’t always read as much as I do now. 
              I’m working to make up for lost time. When I was younger, I was particularly drawn to science fiction and fantasy. 
              Some of my favorite series include The Lord of the Rings and The Witcher Saga.<br/><br/>
              Lately, I’ve discovered immense value in non-fiction books. 
              I enjoy reading scientific titles, especially in the fields of neuroscience and psychology, 
              as well as self-help and philosophical works. Stoic philosophy has a special place in my heart, 
              with Marcus Aurelius being one of my greatest inspirations in this area.<br/><br/>
              That said, I still leave room for fantasy. From time to time, I delve into fiction—recently, 
              I enjoyed The Witcher: Crossroads of Ravens, a prequel to The Witcher Saga. 
              For me, reading is not just a pastime but a way to grow, learn, and escape into fascinating worlds.
